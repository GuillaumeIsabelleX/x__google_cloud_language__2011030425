 # QUOTATION - Methodological scenario

The objective of this work is to write a first draft of what will constitute your ** research topic ** in the next semester. This involves identifying, by following the ** structure of a research protocol **, the ** methodological scenario ** of your research. As the term suggests, it is an action of ** conceptualizing and scripting research **.
This includes ** identification of the context **, of ** the problem **, of the ** conceptual framework **, a first iteration of the ** research question ** and identification, following the content relating to the different sessions, a ** research method **. This is ** to identify the field of research **, the ** data that will be used ** and ** their processing **.


## EVALUATION

* Coherence of all the elements of the research. The logic of the argument. That is to say the organic links between the different sections. ** The scenario identifies a field of study and experimentation ** and ** asks a research question ** which will allow the implementation of a certain number of research steps.
* Quality and clarity of the written expression both in form and content.
* Form: citations in APA format, bibliography and use of the UQAC template o Background: quality of French and organization of the argument
