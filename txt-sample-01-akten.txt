## Reinforced learning (RL)

>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the model is not trained with labels associating inputs with targets. It is neither supervised (with a direct supervisory signal) nor unsupervised (with no supervisory signal), but instead there is a delayed reward signal [Kaelbling, Littman, & Moore, 1996]
>[...]
>decisions or predictions are called actions, and the decision making (or action taking) entity is called an agent. This is because RL is based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Bellman, 1957), where there is a notion of time, and at each time-step, agents **take actions and move between different states**.
